  TUI Requirements

  The `daemontui` script provides a convenient way to run any of the existing
  daemon scripts with default (but adjustable) values. The TUI interface can
  support both keyboard and mouse input (as long as the underlying console
  also supports mouse input) for both option selection and navigation. The
  Debug option will increase verbosity both in the daemon log output and the
  TUI parameters (on exit).
