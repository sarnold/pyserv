### daemontui settings

The daemontui software must know the appropriate default settings, as
well as both allow changes at runtime, and match the pre-configured
values used by the daemon scripts.

Individual settings values are mostly specific to a server
implementation, eg, log file names and socket timeouts.

The software should provide appropriate data structures to handle both
groups of settings and dynamic data such as network device names and
file system paths, starting with user-confirmed runtime settings for
server and logging options.
